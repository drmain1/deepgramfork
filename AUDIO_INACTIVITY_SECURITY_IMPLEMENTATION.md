# Audio Inactivity Security Feature - Implementation Analysis

## Update: July 18, 2025

### Changes Made During Implementation Attempt

#### Files Modified:

1. **backend/deepgram_utils.py**
   - Line 322: Removed `await` from `security_manager.record_audio_received(len(audio_data))` 
   - Issue: The method is not async, but was being called with await, causing TypeError

2. **backend/main.py**
   - Line 33: Changed logging level from `logging.INFO` to `logging.DEBUG`
   - Purpose: To enable debug logging for monitoring the inactivity feature

3. **Deployment**
   - Built and deployed using Chainguard Docker image
   - Deployed to Cloud Run with environment variables already set:
     - `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_ENABLED=true`
     - `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_WARNING=8`
     - `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=15`

### Issues Discovered:

1. **Deepgram Authentication Error (HTTP 401)**
   - Live transcription is completely broken
   - Deepgram connection fails with "server rejected WebSocket connection: HTTP 401"
   - This is unrelated to the audio inactivity feature

2. **Services Start Only on Audio**
   - Deepgram connection only starts when first audio data is received (line 337-340 in deepgram_utils.py)
   - If no audio is sent, Deepgram never connects
   - The 50-55 second timeout observed is likely from the WebSocket connection itself, not our monitor

3. **Audio Inactivity Monitor Status**
   - The monitor initializes correctly for authenticated users
   - However, it only tracks audio if audio is actually sent
   - Since Deepgram fails to connect, no real testing was possible

4. **Debug Logging Impact**
   - Enabling DEBUG level logging may impact performance
   - Many module-specific loggers don't show in Cloud Run logs

### Recommendation:
The implementation has created critical issues with the core transcription functionality. The Deepgram 401 error needs to be resolved before any audio inactivity testing can proceed. Consider reverting all changes and addressing the Deepgram authentication issue first.

## Original Summary of Findings

After thorough investigation, the audio inactivity detection feature appears to be properly implemented but may not be activating due to one of these reasons:

### 1. **Authentication Requirement** (Most Likely)
The security feature only activates for authenticated users. Check your logs for:
```
Audio inactivity monitoring NOT activated. Enabled: true, User ID: None
```

### 2. **Environment Variables Not Set**
The feature checks these environment variables:
- `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_ENABLED` (default: "true")
- `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_WARNING` (default: "8")
- `WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` (default: "15")

### 3. **Logging Level**
Debug logs are needed to see the monitoring in action. Set logging level to DEBUG.

## Quick Fixes Applied

I've added comprehensive debugging to help diagnose the issue:

1. **Enhanced logging in deepgram_utils.py**:
   - Shows whether security monitoring is activated
   - Logs when audio is received and tracked
   - Shows configuration values

2. **Debug logging in websocket_security.py**:
   - Tracks when audio is recorded
   - Shows monitoring loop progress
   - Logs inactivity checks every 5 seconds

3. **Fixed parameter passing bug**:
   - The `record_audio_received` method now properly passes the size parameter

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check the Logs
After deploying the changes, look for these log messages:

**Successful activation:**
```
INFO: Inactivity config: enabled=True, user_id=user123, warning=8s, disconnect=15s
INFO: Audio inactivity monitoring ACTIVATED for user user123: warning=8s, disconnect=15s
INFO: Audio inactivity monitoring started
```

**When audio is received:**
```
DEBUG: Audio tracked: 1024 bytes
DEBUG: Audio received: 1024 bytes, last_audio_time updated from None to 1737089123.45
```

**Monitor checks (every 5 seconds):**
```
DEBUG: Monitor check #5: last_activity=1737089123.45, inactive_seconds=5.2s, warning_sent=False
```

**Warning triggered:**
```
INFO: Audio inactivity warning threshold reached: 8.1s >= 8s
INFO: Sent inactivity warning to client for session 20250117123456789
```

### 2. Test Manually

1. **Enable debug logging**:
   ```python
   # In your main.py or config
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Connect to WebSocket** with authentication
3. **Don't send any audio** for 8+ seconds
4. **Check for warning** in the UI and logs
5. **Wait for disconnect** at 15 seconds

### 3. Use the Test Script
```bash
# Set your auth token
export AUTH_TOKEN="your-firebase-auth-token"

# Run the test
cd backend
python test_audio_inactivity.py
```

## Deployment Checklist

### For Local Testing:
```bash
export WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_ENABLED=true
export WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_WARNING=5   # Faster for testing
export WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=10  # Faster for testing
python main.py
```

### For Cloud Run:
1. **Update cloud-run-service.yaml**:
```yaml
env:
  - name: WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_ENABLED
    value: "true"
  - name: WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_WARNING
    value: "8"
  - name: WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT
    value: "15"
```

2. **Or use gcloud CLI**:
```bash
gcloud run services update your-service \
  --set-env-vars="WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_ENABLED=true,WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_WARNING=8,WEBSOCKET_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=15"
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Audio inactivity monitoring NOT activated"
**Cause**: No authenticated user ID
**Solution**: Ensure Firebase authentication is working properly

### Issue: No warning appears
**Cause**: Frontend not handling the message type
**Solution**: Check that RecordingView.jsx is processing `inactivity_warning` messages

### Issue: Feature works locally but not in production
**Cause**: Environment variables not set in Cloud Run
**Solution**: Deploy with proper environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the debugging changes**
2. **Check the logs** to see which specific issue is occurring
3. **Set environment variables** if needed
4. **Test with authenticated user**
5. **Monitor the logs** for the debug output

The feature is well-implemented and should work once the activation conditions are met. The enhanced logging will quickly reveal why it's not activating in your environment.
