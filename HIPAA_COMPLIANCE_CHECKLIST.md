## üìù Notes

- All GCS buckets already have encryption at rest (AES256)
- Firestore has built-in encryption, but we can add field-level encryption for extra security
- Cloud Armor provides DDoS protection and WAF capabilities
- VPC Service Controls add an extra perimeter of security
- Consider using Cloud HSM for key management in the future

## üîç Verification Steps

After implementing each item:
1. Test functionality with PHI test data (not real)
2. Verify audit logs are capturing events
3. Check security headers in browser dev tools
4. Run security scanning tools
5. Document configuration changes
