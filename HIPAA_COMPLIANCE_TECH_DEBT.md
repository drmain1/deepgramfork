# HIPAA Compliance Technical Debt

## Overview
This document tracks remaining HIPAA compliance requirements that need to be addressed before handling real PHI (Protected Health Information) in production.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Only basic console logging exists
- **Required**: HIPAA requires detailed audit trails of all PHI access
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Structured logging with: user_id, action, resource, timestamp, IP address
  - Log all data access, modifications, and deletions
  - Log failed access attempts
  - Centralized logging system (CloudWatch, ELK stack, etc.)
  - Minimum 6-year retention policy for audit logs
  - Tamper-proof log storage

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Simple user-level access (users can only see their own data)
- **Required**: Granular permission system
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Define roles: Provider, Admin, Auditor, Support, Patient
  - Permission matrix for each role
  - Patient consent management system
  - Delegation mechanism for covering providers
  - Break-glass emergency access with audit trail
  - Principle of least privilege enforcement

### 3. S3 Encryption Verification
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Basic encryption verification added to startup routine
- **Required**: All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Implementation Status**:
  - ✅ S3 encryption verification on startup (checks AES-256)
  - ✅ S3 versioning check for audit trails
  - ⚠️  CORS configuration requires manual setup (IAM user lacks s3:PutBucketCORS permission)
  - ✅ Using base64 data URLs for logo storage (avoids CORS issues)
- **Still Needed**:
  - Consider client-side encryption for sensitive fields
  - Implement key rotation policies
  - Document encryption standards
  - Enable CloudTrail for S3 bucket access logging

## Important Issues (Should Fix Soon)

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion Policies
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: Manual deletion only, no automatic policies
- **Required**: Automated retention and secure deletion
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Automatic data retention policies (configurable per data type)
  - Soft delete with recovery period
  - Secure data purging after retention period
  - Audit trail for all deletions
  - Right to be forgotten compliance

### 5. Security Headers and Rate Limiting
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: Security headers middleware implemented
- **Required**: Comprehensive security headers and rate limiting
- **Implementation Status**:
  - ✅ HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) - 1 year with subdomains
  - ✅ CSP (Content-Security-Policy) - configured for app needs
  - ✅ X-Frame-Options - set to DENY
  - ✅ X-Content-Type-Options - set to nosniff
  - ✅ X-XSS-Protection - enabled
  - ✅ Referrer-Policy - strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **Still Needed**:
  - Rate limiting per user/IP (consider using slowapi or similar)
  - DDoS protection (AWS WAF or CloudFlare)
  - Request size limits for file uploads

### 6. Session Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: No session timeout or management
- **Required**: Secure session handling
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Configurable session timeouts
  - Session timeout warnings
  - Concurrent session limits
  - Device/location tracking
  - Force logout capabilities

## Additional Compliance Requirements

### 7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enforce MFA at Cognito level for all users
- Support for TOTP, SMS, or hardware tokens
- Backup authentication methods

### 8. Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- Ensure BAAs are in place with:
  - AWS (for Cognito, S3, Bedrock)
  - Deepgram
  - Speechmatics
  - Any other third-party services

### 9. Security Monitoring and Incident Response
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Incident response plan
- Breach notification procedures
- Regular security assessments

### 10. Employee Training and Access Controls
- HIPAA training for all employees
- Background checks for employees with PHI access
- Access reviews and deprovisioning procedures
- Signed confidentiality agreements

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phase 1 (Before Beta with Real PHI)**:
   - Implement audit logging (#1)
   - Verify S3 encryption (#3)
   - Basic RBAC implementation (#2)

2. **Phase 2 (Before General Availability)**:
   - Complete RBAC with consent management
   - Data retention policies (#4)
   - Security headers (#5)
   - Session management (#6)

3. **Phase 3 (Ongoing)**:
   - Security monitoring
   - Regular assessments
   - Training programs

## Testing Requirements

Before handling real PHI:
1. Security penetration testing
2. HIPAA compliance audit
3. Disaster recovery testing
4. Access control validation
5. Encryption verification

## Current Implementation Notes (January 2025)

### Recent Updates:
1. **S3 Bucket Security**:
   - Added encryption verification on startup
   - Checks for bucket versioning (audit trails)
   - CORS configuration must be done manually in AWS Console due to IAM permissions
   - Switched to base64 image storage to avoid CORS issues with logos

2. **Security Headers**:
   - Implemented comprehensive security headers middleware
   - Includes HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
   - Ready for HTTPS deployment

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Basic S3 access logging exists
   - Need to implement structured application-level audit logging
   - Consider AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive audit trails

### Manual AWS Console Tasks Required:
1. **S3 Bucket CORS Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "CORSRules": [{
       "ID": "AllowWebAccess",
       "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:5174", "https://yourdomain.com"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
     }]
   }
   ```

2. **S3 Bucket Encryption**:
   - Ensure AES-256 encryption is enabled
   - Consider enabling AWS KMS for key management

3. **IAM Policy Updates**:
   - Current user lacks s3:PutBucketCORS permission (this is fine for security)
   - Review and apply principle of least privilege
