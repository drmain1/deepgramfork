# HIPAA Compliance Technical Debt

## Overview
This document tracks remaining HIPAA compliance requirements that need to be addressed before handling real PHI (Protected Health Information) in production.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Only basic console logging exists
- **Required**: HIPAA requires detailed audit trails of all PHI access
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Structured logging with: user_id, action, resource, timestamp, IP address
  - Log all data access, modifications, and deletions
  - Log failed access attempts
  - Centralized logging system (CloudWatch, ELK stack, etc.)
  - Minimum 6-year retention policy for audit logs
  - Tamper-proof log storage

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Simple user-level access (users can only see their own data)
- **Required**: Granular permission system
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Define roles: Provider, Admin, Auditor, Support, Patient
  - Permission matrix for each role
  - Patient consent management system
  - Delegation mechanism for covering providers
  - Break-glass emergency access with audit trail
  - Principle of least privilege enforcement

### 3. S3 Encryption Verification
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Current State**: Encryption not verified in code
- **Required**: All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Enable S3 server-side encryption (AES-256)
  - Verify encryption settings programmatically
  - Consider client-side encryption for sensitive fields
  - Implement key rotation policies
  - Document encryption standards

## Important Issues (Should Fix Soon)

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion Policies
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: Manual deletion only, no automatic policies
- **Required**: Automated retention and secure deletion
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Automatic data retention policies (configurable per data type)
  - Soft delete with recovery period
  - Secure data purging after retention period
  - Audit trail for all deletions
  - Right to be forgotten compliance

### 5. Security Headers and Rate Limiting
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: Basic CORS configuration only
- **Required**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security)
  - CSP (Content-Security-Policy)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Rate limiting per user/IP
  - DDoS protection

### 6. Session Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Current State**: No session timeout or management
- **Required**: Secure session handling
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Configurable session timeouts
  - Session timeout warnings
  - Concurrent session limits
  - Device/location tracking
  - Force logout capabilities

## Additional Compliance Requirements

### 7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enforce MFA at Cognito level for all users
- Support for TOTP, SMS, or hardware tokens
- Backup authentication methods

### 8. Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- Ensure BAAs are in place with:
  - AWS (for Cognito, S3, Bedrock)
  - Deepgram
  - Speechmatics
  - Any other third-party services

### 9. Security Monitoring and Incident Response
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Incident response plan
- Breach notification procedures
- Regular security assessments

### 10. Employee Training and Access Controls
- HIPAA training for all employees
- Background checks for employees with PHI access
- Access reviews and deprovisioning procedures
- Signed confidentiality agreements

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phase 1 (Before Beta with Real PHI)**:
   - Implement audit logging (#1)
   - Verify S3 encryption (#3)
   - Basic RBAC implementation (#2)

2. **Phase 2 (Before General Availability)**:
   - Complete RBAC with consent management
   - Data retention policies (#4)
   - Security headers (#5)
   - Session management (#6)

3. **Phase 3 (Ongoing)**:
   - Security monitoring
   - Regular assessments
   - Training programs

## Testing Requirements

Before handling real PHI:
1. Security penetration testing
2. HIPAA compliance audit
3. Disaster recovery testing
4. Access control validation
5. Encryption verification
