### 2. **Environment Security** (2-4 hours) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Review all environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Ensure all secrets are in Google Secret Manager
- [ ] Document all API keys and their purposes
- [ ] Implement secret rotation schedule

### 3. **Basic Documentation** (2-4 hours) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Document user access procedures
- [ ] Create basic security incident response plan
- [ ] Document data backup and recovery procedures

## üü° Important but Not Blocking (Post-MVP)

### Access Control Enhancement (2-3 days)

- [ ] Add support for multiple users per practice
- [ ] Implement permission levels (admin, user, read-only)
- [ ] Add user management interface

### Data Management (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement automated data retention policies
- [ ] Create patient data export functionality
- [ ] Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement secure file deletion with overwrite

### Additional Security (1-2 days)
- [ ] Add automatic logout on browser close
- [ ] Implement password history to prevent reuse
- [ ] Add email notifications for new device logins
- [ ] Implement session invalidation on password change
- [ ] Add IP whitelist/blacklist functionality
- [ ] Implement field-level validation for PHI data

## üü¢ Nice to Have (Future Enhancements)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Enable VPC Service Controls
- [ ] Configure Cloud CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up staging environment with same security
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment

### Compliance Documentation
- [ ] Create Business Associate Agreement (BAA) template
- [ ] Create comprehensive incident response plan
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Document security architecture
- [ ] Create HIPAA training materials

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting
- [ ] Add anomaly detection for access patterns
- [ ] Create security incident response automation
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement database read replicas
- [ ] Create security dashboard in Cloud Console

## üí° DDoS Protection: Cloudflare vs Cloud Armor

**For MVP: Cloudflare is sufficient** ‚úÖ

Your current Cloudflare setup provides:
- DDoS protection at the network edge
- WAF capabilities
- SSL/TLS termination
- Rate limiting
- Bot protection

Cloud Armor would provide:
- GCP-native integration
- More granular control
- Better integration with GCP logging
- But requires App Engine deployment

**Recommendation**: Stick with Cloudflare for MVP. Consider Cloud Armor as a future enhancement if you need deeper GCP integration or more sophisticated rules.

## üìä Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. Environment variable security review (2-4 hours)
2. Basic user access documentation (2-4 hours)

### Next 2-3 Days
1. Build audit log viewer interface
2. Implement audit log retention policy
3. Add audit log integrity checks

### Post-MVP (Week 2+)
1. RBAC implementation
2. Data management features
3. Additional security enhancements

## ‚úÖ What's Already Secure

- Strong authentication with MFA option
- Account lockout protection (5 attempts, 30-minute lockout)
- Session management with timeouts and warnings
- Comprehensive security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Daily backups with 30-day retention
- 7-day point-in-time recovery
- Rate limiting and Cloudflare DDoS protection
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- Complete audit logging for all PHI access points

## üéØ Summary

**MVP Status**: 75% complete
- ‚úÖ All security fundamentals implemented
- ‚úÖ All PHI access points have audit logging
- ‚ùå Need audit log viewer (1-2 days)
- ‚ùå Need environment security review (2-4 hours)
- ‚ùå Need basic documentation (2-4 hours)

**Total time to MVP**: 2-3 days of focused work

Everything else can be implemented post-launch as iterative improvements.
