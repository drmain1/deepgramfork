### 2. **Audit Log Access**
- [ ] Create admin interface to view/query audit logs
- [ ] Implement audit log retention policy (6 years for HIPAA)
- [ ] Add audit log integrity checks
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities

### 3. **Environment Security**
- [ ] Review all environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Ensure all secrets are in Google Secret Manager
- [ ] Document all API keys and their purposes
- [ ] Implement secret rotation schedule

## ðŸŸ¡ Important but Not Blocking (Should Have)

### 4. **Access Control Enhancement**
- [ ] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add support for multiple users per practice
- [ ] Implement permission levels (admin, user, read-only)
- [ ] Add user management interface

### 5. **Data Management**
- [ ] Implement automated data retention policies
- [ ] Create patient data export functionality
- [ ] Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement secure file deletion with overwrite

### 6. **Additional Security**
- [ ] Add automatic logout on browser close
- [ ] Implement password history to prevent reuse
- [ ] Add email notifications for new device logins
- [ ] Implement session invalidation on password change
- [ ] Add IP whitelist/blacklist functionality

## ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Could Have)

### 7. **Infrastructure**
- [ ] Set up Cloud Armor DDoS protection (requires App Engine)
- [ ] Enable VPC Service Controls
- [ ] Configure Cloud CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up staging environment with same security
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment

### 8. **Compliance Documentation**
- [ ] Create Business Associate Agreement (BAA) template
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Document security architecture
- [ ] Create HIPAA training materials

### 9. **Advanced Features**
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting
- [ ] Add anomaly detection for access patterns
- [ ] Create security incident response automation
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement database read replicas

## ðŸ“Š Effort Estimates

| Task Category | Effort | Priority |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| ~~Complete Audit Logging~~ | ~~4-6 hours~~ | ~~CRITICAL~~ âœ… **DONE** |
| Audit Log Access | 1-2 days | CRITICAL |
| Environment Security | 2-4 hours | CRITICAL |
| Access Control (RBAC) | 2-3 days | HIGH |
| Data Management | 2-3 days | HIGH |
| Additional Security | 1-2 days | MEDIUM |
| Infrastructure | 1-2 days | LOW |
| Documentation | 1 day | LOW |

## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority:**
   - Build audit log viewer interface (1-2 days)
   - Review and secure environment variables (2 hours)

2. **Next 2-3 Days:**
   - Implement audit log retention policy
   - Add audit log integrity checks  
   - Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities

3. **Following Week:**
   - Implement basic RBAC structure
   - Add patient data export
   - Complete remaining security enhancements

## ðŸŽ‰ Recently Completed (This Session)

### **Complete Audit Logging Implementation** âœ…
All critical audit logging gaps have been addressed:

1. **PDF Generation Endpoints** (`routers/pdf_router.py`):
   - Added comprehensive audit logging to all PDF generation endpoints
   - Logs successful/failed PDF creation, file sizes, patient names, and error details
   - Covers: structured PDFs, transcript PDFs, preview PDFs, multi-visit PDFs, billing PDFs

2. **File Upload/Download** (`routers/image_router.py`):
   - Added audit logging for logo and signature uploads/deletions
   - Tracks file metadata, sizes, content types, and operation outcomes
   - Covers: clinic logo management and signature file management

3. **Authentication Events** (`main.py`):
   - Replaced simple logging with comprehensive AuditLogger usage
   - Enhanced login/logout endpoints with detailed audit trails
   - Added failed authentication attempt tracking with account lockout integration

4. **Session Management** (`firestore_session_manager.py`):
   - Added audit logging for session lifecycle events
   - Tracks session creation, timeout/expiration, and logout events
   - Includes bulk session cleanup auditing for expired sessions

### **Impact:**
- âœ… All PHI access points now have proper audit logging
- âœ… HIPAA-compliant audit trail for all critical operations
- âœ… Enhanced security monitoring and incident response capabilities
- âœ… Reduced compliance risk for production deployment

## âœ… What's Already Secure

- Strong authentication with MFA option
- Account lockout protection
- Session management with timeouts
- Comprehensive security headers
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- Rate limiting and basic DDoS protection
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- Most PHI access is already logged

## ðŸŽ¯ Minimum Viable HIPAA Compliance

To go live, you MUST complete:
1. ~~Audit logging for ALL PHI access points~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
2. Audit log viewer for compliance officers
3. Environment variable security review  
4. Basic user access documentation

**Progress: 1/4 critical requirements completed (25%)**

Everything else can be implemented post-launch as iterative improvements.
