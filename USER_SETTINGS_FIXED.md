# User Settings Path Issue Fixed ✅

## Issue Summary
User settings were not persisting because of a path mismatch in GCS:
- **Save operation** was using `save_data_to_gcs` which created: `{user_id}/settings/user_settings.txt`
- **Read operation** was looking for: `{user_id}/settings/user_settings.json`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Backend Code
- Changed `save_user_settings` endpoint to use `gcs_client.save_user_settings()` instead of `save_data_to_gcs()`
- Fixed path consistency in `gcs_utils.py` to use: `{user_id}/settings/user_settings.json`

### 2. Migrated Existing Data
- Found existing settings at wrong path: `7J67JTZCAhZX3Zmdr8G5CPmiUew2/settings/user_settings.txt`
- Moved to correct path: `7J67JTZCAhZX3Zmdr8G5CPmiUew2/settings/user_settings.json`
- Verified settings are now accessible

### 3. Verified Fix
```
✅ Settings retrieved successfully
   Name: Not set
   Specialty: Chiropractic
```

## Correct GCS Path Structure
```
{user_id}/
├── settings/
│   └── user_settings.json      ✅ User settings (JSON)
├── transcripts/
│   ├── original/
│   │   └── {session_id}.txt    ✅ Original transcripts
│   └── polished/
│       └── {session_id}.txt    ✅ Polished transcripts
└── metadata/
    └── {session_id}.json       ✅ Session metadata
```

## Next Steps
1. The backend will now correctly save and retrieve user settings
2. Settings will persist across sessions
3. All new saves will use the correct path structure

Your user settings should now work properly!
