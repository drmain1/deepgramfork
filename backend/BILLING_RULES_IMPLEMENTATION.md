# Billing Rules Implementation Summary

## Overview
The billing rules system has been implemented with a simple, two-tier approach:
1. **Base Rules**: Standard billing rules for all clinics (read-only)
2. **Custom Rules**: User-specific additions that append to base rules

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Base Billing Rules** (`backend/base_billing_rules.py`)
   - Comprehensive set of standard medical billing rules
   - Covers CPT codes, ICD-10 codes, modifiers, documentation requirements
   - Includes time-based billing, insurance considerations, compliance notes

2. **User Settings Model** (`backend/core_models.py`)
   - Added `customBillingRules: Optional[str]` field to UserSettingsData

3. **Billing Endpoint** (`backend/main.py`)
   - Updated `/api/v1/patients/{patient_id}/generate-billing` endpoint
   - Automatically combines base rules + user custom rules + request-specific instructions
   - Made `billing_instructions` optional in BillingRequest model

### Frontend Changes

1. **Settings Page** (`my-vite-react-app/src/pages/SettingsPage.jsx`)
   - Added "Billing Rules" as 6th tab
   - Integrated with UserSettingsContext

2. **Billing Rules Tab** (`my-vite-react-app/src/components/BillingRulesTab.jsx`)
   - Simple textarea for custom billing rules
   - Provides example rules and guidance
   - Auto-saves to user settings

3. **User Settings Context** (`my-vite-react-app/src/contexts/UserSettingsContext.jsx`)
   - Added `customBillingRules` to state
   - Added `updateCustomBillingRules` function

4. **Patient Transcript List** (`my-vite-react-app/src/pages/PatientTranscriptList.jsx`)
   - Updated to send empty billing_instructions (backend handles rules automatically)

## How It Works

1. **Rule Storage**:
   - Base rules are stored in `base_billing_rules.py` (version controlled)
   - Custom rules are stored per-user in Firestore

2. **Rule Application**:
   - When generating billing, the system automatically:
     1. Loads base billing rules
     2. Fetches user's custom billing rules
     3. Combines them in order: Base → Custom → Request-specific
   - The combined rules are sent to Gemini 2.5 Pro for billing generation

3. **User Experience**:
   - Users go to Settings → Billing Rules tab
   - They see a text area where they can add custom rules
   - These rules supplement (not replace) the base rules
   - Changes are saved automatically to their profile

## Example Custom Rules

```
## Orthopedic Surgery Specific
- Always include laterality (left/right) for joint procedures
- Document implant details for billing hardware codes

## Workers' Compensation
- Include employer name and claim number
- Add WC modifier to all applicable codes

## Local Insurance Requirements
- Blue Cross requires prior auth number in notes
- Medicare Advantage plans need specific documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No complex profile management
2. **Flexibility**: Users can add specialty-specific rules
3. **Consistency**: Base rules ensure standard compliance
4. **Maintainability**: Base rules can be updated centrally

## Future Enhancements

1. Rule validation/syntax checking
2. Rule templates library
3. Import/export functionality
4. Rule versioning and history
