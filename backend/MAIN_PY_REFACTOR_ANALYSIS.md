# Main.py Refactor Analysis - July 2, 2025

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the main.py refactor performed on July 2, 2025. The refactor transformed a monolithic main.py file into a modular, service-oriented architecture with significant changes to data storage, middleware handling, and API organization.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. User Settings Storage Migration

**Before Refactor:**
- Settings stored directly in Firestore using `get_user_settings_firestore()` and `update_user_settings_firestore()`
- All data persisted immediately to Firestore
- No caching mechanism

**After Refactor:**
- Hybrid storage approach: Primary storage in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), with Firestore for metadata/summaries
- Created `UserSettingsService` class to manage all settings operations
- Added 5-minute in-memory cache for performance
- Settings stored as JSON in GCS at path: `{user_id}/settings/user_settings.json`

**Impact:**
- Better performance through caching
- Ability to store larger settings data
- Potential for cache inconsistency issues
- **Bug discovered**: Initial sync_to_firestore only saved summaries, not full data (now fixed)

### 2. Service Layer Introduction

**New Services Created:**
```python
services/
├── __init__.py
├── user_settings_service.py  # Centralized settings management
```

**UserSettingsService Features:**
- Unified interface for all settings operations
- Built-in caching with TTL
- Migration support for legacy formats
- Transcription profile management
- Firestore sync capabilities

### 3. Middleware Reorganization

**Before Refactor:**
- All middleware logic inline in main.py
- Mixed concerns (security, CORS, HIPAA compliance)

**After Refactor:**
```python
middleware/
├── __init__.py
├── cors_middleware.py      # CORS configuration
├── security_middleware.py   # Security headers & HIPAA compliance
```

**Key Improvements:**
- `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`: Handles all security-related headers
- `HIPAAComplianceMiddleware`: Audit logging and PHI protection
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to test and modify

### 4. Router-Based API Organization

**New Router Structure:**
```python
routers/
├── __init__.py
├── image_router.py  # All image-related endpoints
```

**Benefits:**
- Modular endpoint organization
- Dependency injection for router initialization
- Clear API versioning (v1)
- Easier to add new feature areas

### 5. Image Handling Overhaul

**Before Refactor:**
- Images stored as base64 strings in Firestore
- Limited by Firestore document size constraints
- Inefficient for large images

**After Refactor:**
- Created `ImageHandler` class for all image operations
- Images stored as files in GCS
- Public URLs generated for image access
- Size validation (10MB limit)
- Format validation (PNG, JPG, JPEG only)
- Migration endpoints to convert existing base64 data

**New Image Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/upload_logo` - Upload clinic logo
- `POST /api/v1/upload_signature` - Upload doctor signature
- `GET /api/v1/logo/{user_id}` - Get logo URL
- `GET /api/v1/signature/{user_id}` - Get signature URL
- `POST /api/v1/migrate_images` - Migrate base64 to GCS

### 6. WebSocket Authentication Enhancement

**Created `WebSocketAuthWrapper`:**
- Centralized WebSocket authentication
- Unified audit logging for connections
- Better error handling and lifecycle management
- Consistent authentication across all WebSocket endpoints

### 7. Model Extraction

**All Pydantic models moved to `models.py`:**
- `UserSettingsData`
- `SaveUserSettingsRequest`
- `TranscriptionProfile`
- `SessionData`
- Request/Response models

**Benefits:**
- Centralized data contracts
- Shared validation logic
- Cleaner main.py file

## API Changes

### User Settings Endpoints

**GET /api/v1/user_settings/{user_id}**
- Now reads from UserSettingsService (GCS + cache)
- Falls back to Firestore if GCS fails
- Returns camelCase JSON

**POST /api/v1/user_settings**
- Saves to GCS via UserSettingsService
- Syncs to Firestore after save
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Deleted Files
- `main_middleware_refactor.py` - Temporary refactor work
- `main_refactor_example.py` - Refactor prototype
- `main_refactored_snippet.py` - Code snippets

## Global State Management

**Before:**
```python
# Direct client initialization
gcs_client = None
deepgram_client = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Centralized initialization in startup event
user_settings_service = None
image_handler_instance = None

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    global gcs_client, user_settings_service, image_handler_instance
    # Initialize all services
```

## Testing & Debugging

**New Test Scripts:**
- `test_user_settings_persistence.py` - Verify GCS/Firestore sync
- `check_user_settings.py` - API-level testing
- `test_gcs_operations.py` - GCS functionality
- `test_gcs_health.py` - Storage health checks

## Migration Considerations

1. **Base64 Image Migration**:
   - Run `/api/v1/migrate_images` for each user
   - Converts base64 data to GCS files
   - Updates settings with new URLs

2. **Settings Format Migration**:
   - `UserSettingsService.migrate_legacy_format()` handles format changes
   - Converts old dict-based macro phrases to list format

3. **Cache Considerations**:
   - 5-minute TTL means changes may not reflect immediately
   - Use `invalidate_cache()` for immediate updates
   - Multi-instance deployments need cache coordination

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Settings Not Persisting
**Cause**: sync_to_firestore only saved summaries
**Solution**: Updated to sync full settings data

### Issue 2: Image Upload Failures
**Cause**: GCS permissions or size limits
**Solution**: Check GCS bucket permissions, validate file sizes

### Issue 3: Cache Inconsistency
**Cause**: Multiple instances with local caches
**Solution**: Consider Redis for distributed caching

### Issue 4: WebSocket Authentication
**Cause**: Token validation in different format
**Solution**: WebSocketAuthWrapper handles all auth consistently

## Performance Improvements

1. **Caching**: 5-minute cache reduces GCS calls
2. **File Storage**: Images served directly from GCS
3. **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are async
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuses client connections

## Security Enhancements

1. **HIPAA Compliance Middleware**: Audit logging for all PHI access
2. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers on all responses
3. **Image Validation**: File type and size validation
4. **Token Validation**: Centralized auth for WebSockets

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dependency Injection**: Services initialized once and injected
2. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses
3. **Logging**: Structured logging throughout
4. **Type Hints**: Full type annotations
5. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Service Initialization**: Ensure all services are initialized in startup_event
2. **Verify GCS Permissions**: User must have GCS write access
3. **Monitor Cache**: Check if issues resolve after 5 minutes (cache expiry)
4. **Review Logs**: Look for sync_to_firestore success/failure messages
5. **Test Migration**: Ensure all users have migrated images/settings

## Future Considerations

1. **Distributed Caching**: Move from in-memory to Redis
2. **Background Jobs**: Async processing for heavy operations
3. **API Versioning**: Consider v2 for breaking changes
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limits to prevent abuse
5. **Monitoring**: Add APM for performance tracking
