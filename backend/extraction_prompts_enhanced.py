# Enhanced initial evaluation findings extraction
ENHANCED_INITIAL_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """
Extract ALL positive clinical findings from this initial evaluation for baseline documentation.

IMPORTANT: Generate TWO outputs in the exact format specified below.

Part 1: Markdown Summary
Create a well-formatted clinical summary using proper markdown formatting.
- Use ### for main title
- Use #### for category headers
- Use - for bullet points
- Focus on clarity and readability

Part 2: JSON Data
Create a structured JSON object with categorized findings.
Each finding should be a verbatim quote from the transcript.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY AS:
```markdown
### Clinical Baseline Summary

#### Pain Findings
- [List each pain finding]

#### Range of Motion Findings
- [List each ROM limitation]

#### Neurological Findings
- [List each neurological finding]

#### Palpation Findings
- [List each palpation finding]

#### Orthopedic Test Findings
- [List each positive test]

#### Functional Limitations
- [List each functional limitation]

#### Posture and Gait Findings
- [List each postural/gait abnormality]

#### Outcome Assessment Tools
- [List each assessment tool with score]

*Initial evaluation performed on [Date if available]*
```

  "outcome_assessment_tools": [
    {
      "tool_name": "[Name of the tool]",
      "score": "[The score]",
      "interpretation": "[The interpretation if mentioned]"

  ],
  "posture_and_gait_findings": [
    "[Direct quote of postural or gait abnormality]"
  ]
}
```

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Only include POSITIVE/ABNORMAL findings
2. Use exact quotes from the transcript
3. If a category has no findings, use empty array []
4. Include all relevant clinical details
5. Maintain professional medical terminology
