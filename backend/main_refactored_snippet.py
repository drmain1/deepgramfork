Example of how to update main.py to use the refactored image handling code.
This shows the key changes needed - not a complete file.

# At the top of main.py, add these imports:
from image_handler import ImageHandler
from routers import image_router

# In the lifespan function, initialize the image handler:
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup
    global gcs_client, vertex_ai_client, image_handler_instance
    print("FastAPI startup: Initializing GCP clients...")
    
    # Initialize GCS client
    try:
        gcs_client = GCSClient()
        print("✓ GCS client initialized successfully during startup.")
        
        # Initialize image handler
        image_handler_instance = ImageHandler(gcs_client)
        print("✓ Image handler initialized successfully.")
        
        # Initialize the image router with dependencies
        image_router.init_router(image_handler_instance, DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS)
        print("✓ Image router initialized successfully.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to initialize during startup: {e}")
        gcs_client = None
    
    yield  # Server is running
    
    # Shutdown
    print("FastAPI shutdown: Cleaning up resources...")

# After creating the FastAPI app, include the router:
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

# ... (your existing middleware setup) ...

# Include the image router
app.include_router(image_router.router)

# REMOVE all the individual image endpoints (lines 470-1006 in your current main.py):
# - upload_logo
# - delete_logo  
# - debug_logo
# - migrate_logo
# - upload_signature
# - delete_signature
# - migrate_signature

# The rest of your endpoints remain unchanged
