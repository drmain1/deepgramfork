We are working on building a hipaa complaint medical dictation application, hosted on AWS based on S3 buckets no DB. 

we will be working on improving UI and functionality our current goal is to get this to be a production ready saas application so make sure to ensure all decisions reflect clean modern design to be used by professionals, avoid complex UI when simple will work.  

## Critical Rules - DO NOT VIOLATE

- **NEVER create mock data or simplified components** unless explicitly told to do so

- **NEVER replace existing complex components with simplified versions** - always fix the actual problem

- **ALWAYS work with the existing codebase** - do not create new simplified alternatives

- **ALWAYS find and fix the root cause** of issues instead of creating workarounds

- When debugging issues, focus on fixing the existing implementation, not replacing it

- When something doesn't work, debug and fix it - don't start over with a simple version
