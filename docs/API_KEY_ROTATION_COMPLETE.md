# API Key Rotation Complete ✅

## What We Did

### 1. Secured Your Existing API Key
- Added domain restrictions to your compromised key
- Allowed referrers: localhost:5173, localhost:5174, medlegaldoc.com
- This provides immediate protection even if someone has the old key

### 2. Created a New API Key
- **New API Key**: `AIzaSyB6a5fkjD5O90jEqQAONJF9C9tTdRVxX64`
- Display Name: "Medical Transcription Web App Key"
- Restricted to only necessary Firebase services:
  - Identity Toolkit (Authentication)
  - Firebase Installations
  - Firebase Storage
  - Secure Token Service
- Domain restricted to your allowed domains

### 3. Updated Your Application
- Updated `.env` file with the new API key
- The old key is no longer in your codebase

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Your Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then restart:
cd my-vite-react-app
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Your Application
- Test login/logout
- Test file uploads
- Verify all Firebase features work

### 3. Delete the Old Key (After Testing)
Once you've confirmed everything works with the new key:
```bash
# Delete the old compromised key
gcloud services api-keys delete 3aa1fd2e-3639-4839-93a4-0131cdd06cb8
```

## Security Notes

✅ **Your API keys are now protected by:**
- Domain restrictions (only your domains can use them)
- API restrictions (only necessary services enabled)
- The old key has immediate protection via domain restrictions

✅ **Remember:**
- Firebase API keys are meant to be public (they identify your project)
- Real security comes from Firebase Auth and Security Rules
- Domain restrictions prevent unauthorized usage
- Your repo is now private, adding another layer of protection

## Current API Keys

- Key ID: `3aa1fd2e-3639-4839-93a4-0131cdd06cb8`

### New Key (Active)
- Key ID: `8100945a-5007-401b-a88c-968f03e79930`
- Status: Active and properly restricted

## CLI Commands for Future Reference
