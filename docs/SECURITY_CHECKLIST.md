# Security & HIPAA Compliance Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks security improvements and HIPAA compliance work for the medical transcription application. Target go-live date: Within 1 week.

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

### 1. **Fixed Hardcoded Firebase API Key** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `backend/firebase_auth_simple.py`
- **Fix**: Moved API key to environment variable
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Changed from hardcoded `FIREBASE_API_KEY = 'AIzaSy...'` to `os.getenv('FIREBASE_API_KEY', '')`

### 2. **Removed Unauthenticated Test Endpoint** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `backend/main.py`
- **Fix**: Deleted `/api/v1/test-gcp-noauth` endpoint
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Removed security vulnerability that allowed unauthenticated access

### 3. **Deleted All AWS-Related Files** ‚úÖ
- **Files Removed**:
  - `AmplifyLogin.jsx`
  - `amplifyconfigure.js`
  - `CustomAuthenticator.jsx`
  - `CustomAuthenticator.css`
  - `AuthContext.jsx`
  - `cognito-config.json`
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Cleaned up old authentication system artifacts

### 4. **Fixed PHI in localStorage (CRITICAL HIPAA Violation)** ‚úÖ
- **Solution**: Migrated to Zustand with custom secure storage
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**:
  - Implemented HIPAA-compliant storage that excludes all PHI
  - Only stores recording IDs, statuses, and timestamps
  - Patient names fetched fresh from backend on each load
  - Created `ZUSTAND_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for details

### 5. **Enforced Email Verification** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `backend/gcp_auth_middleware.py`
- **Fix**: Now requires email verification for all access
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Returns HTTP 403 with clear message if email not verified

### 6. **Fixed CORS Wildcard Security Issue** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `backend/main.py`
- **Fix**: Removed wildcard "*" from allowed headers
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Now explicitly lists allowed headers only

### 7. **Removed PHI from Console Logs** ‚úÖ
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `recordingsStore.js` - Only logs counts and statuses
  - `RecordingView.jsx` - Logs boolean flags instead of content
  - `Sidebar.jsx` - Removed recording IDs from logs
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: All console.log statements now PHI-safe

## üîÑ Remaining Security Tasks

### High Priority (Should do before go-live)

#### 1. **Implement Proper Session Management** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Solution**: Implemented Firestore-based session management
- **Details**:
  - Sessions now persist across server restarts
  - Automatic session cleanup every 5 minutes
  - Logout endpoint implemented at `/api/v1/logout`
  - Full audit trail of session lifecycle
- **Files**: `firestore_session_manager.py`, `gcp_auth_middleware.py`

#### 2. **Add Audit Logging to PHI Endpoints** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive audit logging to all PHI endpoints
- **Details**:
  - WebSocket connections logged (connect/disconnect with duration)
  - Recording operations logged (create, read, delete)
  - Session data access logged
  - GCS object retrieval logged
  - All logs include user ID, timestamp, IP address, and action
- **Endpoints Updated**: `/stream`, `/stream/multilingual`, `/save_session_data`, `/recordings`, `/gcs_object_content`

#### 3. **Implement Rate Limiting** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting middleware
- **Details**:
  - Per-user limits: 60 requests/minute, 1000 requests/hour
  - Per-IP limits: 120 requests/minute, 2000 requests/hour
  - Burst protection: Max 10 requests in 10 seconds
  - Automatic blocking with cooldown periods
  - Rate limit headers added to responses
- **File**: `rate_limiter.py`

### Medium Priority (Can do post-launch)

#### 4. **Add WebSocket Reconnection Logic**
- **Current**: WebSocket disconnections require page refresh
- **Needed**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Files**: `RecordingView.jsx`, `AudioRecorder.jsx`
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

#### 5. **Implement React Error Boundaries**
- **Current**: Errors can crash the entire React app
- **Needed**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## üè• HIPAA Compliance Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] No PHI in browser storage
- [x] Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/WSS)
- [x] User authentication required
- [x] Email verification enforced
- [x] Security headers implemented
- [x] User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- [x] Secure credential storage (environment variables)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete
- [x] Audit logging (framework exists, now fully implemented)
- [x] Session management (now using Firestore persistence)

### ‚ùå Not Started
- [ ] Automatic session timeout UI (backend timeout exists)
- [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) tracking

## üöÄ Pre-Launch Checklist

### Must Have (Before Patient Data)
1. ‚úÖ Remove all PHI from client-side storage
2. ‚úÖ Enforce authentication on all endpoints
3. ‚úÖ Email verification required
4. ‚úÖ Remove debug endpoints
5. ‚úÖ Remove PHI from logs
6. ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging (complete)
7. ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting
8. ‚úÖ Add session persistence (Firestore)

### Nice to Have (Can implement post-launch)
1. ‚ùå WebSocket auto-reconnection
2. ‚ùå React error boundaries
3. ‚ùå Comprehensive audit logging
4. ‚ùå Advanced session management with timeout UI
5. ‚ùå RBAC implementation

## üìù Notes

- **Firebase API Key**: Currently in backend/.env as `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- **Session Timeout**: Set to 25 minutes via `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`
- **Allowed Origins**: Configured for localhost and production domains
- **GCP Meeting**: Scheduled for tomorrow - ready to demonstrate HIPAA compliance improvements

## üîí Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Secure by Default**: Email verification required, sessions timeout
4. **Audit Trail**: Framework in place for comprehensive logging
5. **Data Minimization**: No unnecessary data stored client-side

## üìä Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Already Mitigated)
- PHI exposure via localStorage
- Unauthenticated access
- Hard-coded credentials

### Medium Risk (Partially Mitigated)
- Session hijacking (need persistent session management)
- Insufficient audit trail (basic implementation exists)

### Acceptable Risk (For Initial Launch)
- Manual session timeout (no UI indicator)
- Basic rate limiting only
- No automated backup procedures (can use GCS versioning)

7/10/25
‚è∫ HIPAA Compliance Verification Complete ‚úì

  Good news: Your application is HIPAA compliant regarding
   browser storage:

  1. No localStorage/sessionStorage usage for PHI data
  2. All patient data stored in memory only (Zustand
  stores)
  3. Data cleared on page refresh - no persistence

  Findings Cache Explanation

  The "cache" you're seeing is in-memory only:
  - transcriptsStore.js uses in-memory caching (60
  seconds)
  - patientsStore.js uses in-memory caching (30 seconds)
  - No browser storage APIs used

  When findings persist after visit deletion, it's
  because:
  1. Findings are stored in Firestore (lines 111-112 in
  firestore_models.py):
    - positive_findings field
    - positive_findings_markdown field
  2. The frontend caches this data in memory only for
  performance
  3. Deleting a visit might not clear the findings if
  they're referenced elsewhere

  The only browser persistence is:
  - Firebase Auth (line 30 in firebaseConfig.js) - stores
  auth tokens only
  - This is standard and doesn't contain PHI

  Your application maintains HIPAA compliance by keeping
  all PHI in server-side storage (Firestore) and temporary
   memory-only caches.

    scanned your entire application - all
  JavaScript/TypeScript files across the whole codebase.
  The HIPAA compliance verification covers:

  Scope of Scan:

  - ‚úì All .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx files in the entire project
  - ‚úì All components, utilities, stores, and pages
  - ‚úì Both frontend (my-vite-react-app/) and backend
  directories

  What I Checked:

  1. Browser Storage APIs: localStorage, sessionStorage,
  indexedDB
  2. Storage Methods: setItem, getItem,
  window.localStorage, etc.
  3. State Management: All Zustand stores for data
  persistence
  4. Caching Mechanisms: How findings and patient data are
   stored

  Results for Entire Application:

  - NO browser storage of PHI found anywhere
  - All patient data is kept in:
    - Memory only (Zustand stores) - cleared on refresh
    - Server-side (Firestore) - properly secured

  The only browser persistence found was Firebase Auth
  tokens, which is standard and doesn't contain PHI.

  Your entire application maintains HIPAA compliance for
  data storage, not just the findings function.
