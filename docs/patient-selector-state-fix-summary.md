# Patient Selector State Fix - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **patientsStore.js**
- Added `getPatientById` selector to fetch fresh patient data by ID

### 2. **PatientSelector.jsx**
- Added effect to sync with store updates when editing
- Modified to always fetch fresh patient data using `getPatientById`
- Added protection against updating form while user is actively typing

### 3. **transcriptionSessionStore.js**
- Changed `selectedPatient` to `selectedPatientId` (storing ID instead of object)
- Updated all related methods to work with patient IDs
- Maintains single source of truth pattern

### 4. **SetupView.jsx**
- Updated to use `selectedPatientId` from store
- Added `getPatientById` to fetch fresh patient data
- Computes `selectedPatient` from store on each render

## How It Works

1. **Before**: Parent components stored full patient object which became stale after updates
2. **After**: Parent components store only patient ID, always fetching fresh data from store

## Benefits
- ✅ No more stale patient data
- ✅ Edit dialog always shows latest AI context notes
- ✅ Single source of truth (patientsStore)
- ✅ Automatic updates when patient data changes
- ✅ Better performance (storing IDs vs objects)

## Testing the Fix
1. Select a patient
2. Edit patient and add AI context notes
3. Update the patient
4. Click Edit Patient again
5. The AI context notes should populate correctly

The fix ensures that whenever the Edit Patient dialog opens, it fetches the latest patient data from the store, preventing any stale state issues.
