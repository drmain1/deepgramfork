# Treatment Date Handling

## Overview

This document describes how the system handles treatment dates in both regular transcription mode and dictation mode, and how dates are passed to the LLM for generating polished medical notes.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the `date_of_treatment` field was missing from polished notes when using regular transcription mode (non-dictation). This occurred because the system only provided date context to the LLM when a specific `original_date_of_service` was present (dictation mode).

## Solution Implementation

### File: `backend/firestore_endpoints.py`

The fix was implemented in two locations where LLM instructions are constructed:

#### Location 1: Lines 533-536
```python
if original_date_of_service:
    custom_instructions += f"\nDate of Service: {original_date_of_service}"
else:
    from datetime import datetime
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
    custom_instructions += f"\nDate of Service: {current_date}"
```

#### Location 2: Lines 548-555
```python
if original_date_of_service:
    custom_instructions += f"\nDate of Service: {original_date_of_service}"
    logger.info(f"Added date of service to instructions: {original_date_of_service}")
else:
    from datetime import datetime
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
    custom_instructions += f"\nDate of Service: {current_date}"
    logger.info(f"Added current date as date of service: {current_date}")
```

## How It Works

### Regular Transcription Mode
- **Scenario**: User performs a real-time transcription for a current patient visit
- **Date Source**: Current system date (automatically generated)
- **Format**: MM/DD/YYYY
- **LLM Context**: "Date of Service: [current_date]"
- **Result**: LLM populates `date_of_treatment` with current date

### Dictation Mode
- **Scenario**: User records notes for a past patient visit
- **Date Source**: User-selected date from the UI
- **Format**: MM/DD/YYYY
- **LLM Context**: "Date of Service: [selected_date]"
- **Result**: LLM populates `date_of_treatment` with selected past date

## Date Format

All dates are formatted as **MM/DD/YYYY** to ensure consistency across the system and proper parsing by the LLM.

## Logging

The system logs date handling for debugging purposes:
- When a specific date is provided: `"Added date of service to instructions: {date}"`
- When current date is used: `"Added current date as date of service: {date}"`

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Regular Transcription Mode**:
   - Start a new encounter without selecting dictation mode
   - Perform transcription
   - Check that polished note includes current date in `date_of_treatment`

2. **Dictation Mode**:
   - Start a new encounter and enable dictation mode
   - Select a past date
   - Perform transcription
   - Check that polished note includes selected date in `date_of_treatment`

## Future Considerations

- Consider time zone handling for multi-location practices
- Evaluate if time component should be included in addition to date
- Monitor LLM performance with date context to ensure consistent parsing
