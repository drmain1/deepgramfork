# Project Documentation Plan

## 1. Objective
To create a single Markdown document that provides a moderate level of detail about each relevant source file in the project, aiding in understanding and future development.

## 2. Scope & Exclusions
*   **Files to Document:** All files within the project directory (`/Users/davidmain/Desktop/cursor_projects/github_fork`) and its subdirectories.
*   **Exclusions:** Files and directories matching patterns found in the [`.rooignore`](.rooignore) file. We will not be specifically excluding test files at this stage, so everything not in `.rooignore` will be considered.
*   **Primary Focus:** Source code files (e.g., `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`). Other critical configuration files might be briefly noted if encountered, but the detailed analysis will be on code.

## 3. Output
*   **Format:** A single Markdown file (e.g., `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`).
*   **Structure per File Entry:**
    *   **File Path:** Clearly stated (e.g., `### my-vite-react-app/src/components/AudioRecorder.jsx`).
    *   **Summary:** A paragraph describing the file's overall role, main responsibilities, and general functionality.
    *   **Key Definitions:**
        *   A list of important functions, classes, or components defined within the file.
        *   For each, a brief (1-2 sentence) description of its specific purpose.
    *   **Major Dependencies:**
        *   A list of notable internal modules (other files within this project) it imports.
        *   A list of key external libraries or packages it imports.

## 4. Process (to be executed in a suitable implementation mode, like "Code" mode)
*   **Step 1: List All Files:** Use the `list_files` tool recursively on the project root (`.`) to get a complete inventory.
*   **Step 2: Filter Files:**
    *   Read the [`.rooignore`](.rooignore) file.
    *   Programmatically remove any files/directories from the inventory that match the `.rooignore` patterns.
*   **Step 3: Document Each Relevant File:** For every file remaining in the filtered list:
    *   Use `read_file` to get its full content.
    *   Use `list_code_definition_names` for that file to get a structured list of its definitions.
    *   Analyze the code (imports, logic, definitions identified) to extract the information needed for the "Moderate Detail" structure outlined above.
    *   Draft the Markdown section for this specific file.
*   **Step 4: Compile Single Document:** Concatenate all the individual file documentation sections into one cohesive Markdown string, forming the content of `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
*   **Step 5: Write to File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to save the compiled Markdown string to `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` in the project root.
