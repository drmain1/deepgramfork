Implementation Plan for Medical Dictation Application
Overview
We are developing a multi-tenant SaaS medical dictation application for doctors, leveraging Deepgram's speech-to-text streaming (nova-3-medical model) and polishing transcripts with Claude Haiku via AWS Bedrock. The application will be hosted on AWS, ensuring HIPAA compliance, and will feature a modern, user-friendly UI built with React and Chakra UI. The backend will use FastAPI with Uvicorn, orchestrated via AWS CDK in Python, and the infrastructure will include modern web development practices with Docker, ECS, and ALB. Notes will be stored in S3 with a 10-day retention period, and integration with AWS HealthLake for FHIR-based EMR systems will be implemented.
Technology Stack
Backend: FastAPI with Uvicorn (Python)

Frontend: React with Chakra UI (using Vite)

Infrastructure: AWS (VPC, Cognito, S3, ECS with Fargate, ALB)

AI Services:
Deepgram (nova-3-medical model, WebSocket streaming)

AWS Bedrock (Claude Haiku for text polishing)

Containerization: Docker

Infrastructure as Code: AWS CDK (Python)

Storage: S3 (audio files and notes with 10-day retention)

EMR Integration: AWS HealthLake (FHIR)

Implementation Steps
1. Infrastructure Setup
Create a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones.

Configure NAT Gateways and route tables for secure outbound traffic from private subnets.

Set up Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool for multi-tenant authentication.

Create an S3 bucket for audio files and polished notes with tenant-specific prefixes (e.g., tenant-id/audio/ and tenant-id/notes/).

Configure S3 bucket with server-side encryption (SSE-KMS) for HIPAA compliance.

Set up an ECS cluster with Fargate for serverless container management.

Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to the ECS services.

Define IAM roles with least privilege for ECS tasks, S3 access, and Bedrock/Deepgram integrations.

Enable VPC flow logs and CloudTrail for auditability.

2. Backend Development
Initialize a FastAPI project with Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

Implement a WebSocket endpoint (/stream) to receive audio streams from the frontend.

Integrate Deepgram's WebSocket API (nova-3-medical model) for real-time transcription.

Implement logic to send completed transcriptions to AWS Bedrock (Claude Haiku) for polishing.

Store raw audio in S3 (tenant-id/audio/[timestamp].wav).

Store polished notes in S3 (tenant-id/notes/[note-id].txt).

Implement authentication with Cognito JWT validation.

Add error handling and logging to CloudWatch.

3. Frontend Development
Set up a React project with Vite and Chakra UI.

Implement authentication using AWS Amplify or a custom Cognito client.

Create a recording interface using the MediaRecorder API to capture and stream audio.

Display live transcriptions received from the WebSocket.

Show the polished note once processing is complete, with basic editing capabilities.

Ensure the UI is responsive and follows modern design principles.

4. Containerization and Deployment
Create a Dockerfile for the backend FastAPI app.

Create a Dockerfile for the frontend React app (using Nginx to serve static files).

Build and push both images to Amazon ECR.

Define ECS task definitions for backend and frontend services.

Configure the ALB to route requests to the appropriate services.

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.

5. Testing and HIPAA Compliance
Ensure data encryption at rest (S3 SSE-KMS) and in transit (TLS for ALB, WebSockets).

Implement access controls via IAM and Cognito.

Set up logging to CloudWatch with a retention policy.

Conduct functional testing for the end-to-end flow.

Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing).

Confirm HIPAA compliance, including BAAs with AWS and Deepgram.

6. Monitoring and Maintenance
Configure CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and alarms.

Set up S3 lifecycle policy to delete notes after 10 days.

Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.

7. AWS HealthLake Integration
Create an AWS HealthLake data store for FHIR resources.

Map polished notes to appropriate FHIR resources (e.g., DocumentReference).

Implement API calls to push notes to HealthLake.

Ensure data is structured according to FHIR standards.
