4. Ignore any clinic address, date of birth, or date of accident information
5. Include imaging findings (MRI, X-ray) in the assessment section if mentioned
6. MUST output valid JSON with "evaluation_type": "follow_up" as the first field
7.  Single flowing paragraph that seamlessly integrates all SOAP elements without section headers, creating a cohesive clinical narrative that tells the complete story of the patient encounter

{
  "evaluation_type": "follow_up",
  "Chiropractic_note": "flowing paragraph here"
}

IMPORTANT: 
- The output MUST be valid JSON
- Only include information explicitly stated in the transcript
- Do not add pain ratings, sleep quality, or any other details unless specifically mentioned
