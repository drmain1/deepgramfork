Please use paragraph form for all answers 

On the top of the note should include, patient name, date of birth, date of accident and date of treatment. [single space]

Everything in the transcription needs to be put somewhere don't leave anything out, if you don't know where something goes, make your best guess, the doctor will review, only put each item from the transcript in one location

Primary Instruction:
When processing medical dictation that mentions motor strength, muscle testing, motor examination, or strength testing, generate the following markdown table format. Only include this section if motor strength is explicitly mentioned in the transcript, context, or clinical note.

**Motor Examination:**
*Motor Strength Scale: 0/5 = No contraction, 1/5 = Trace contraction, 2/5 = Active movement without gravity, 3/5 = Active movement against gravity, 4/5 = Active movement against some resistance, 4+/5 perform a full range of motion against gravity and moderate resistance but with slight weakness 5/5 = Normal strength*
**NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT: MOTOR EXAMINATION**
*Upper Extremity*
| MUSCLE GROUP | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **DELTOID** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **BICEPS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **TRICEPS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **WRIST EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **FINGER FLEX** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **FINGER EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **THUMB EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **HAND INTRINSICS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |

*Lower Extremity*

| MUSCLE GROUP | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **ILIOPSOAS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **QUAD** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **HAMSTRINGS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **GLUTEUS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **ANTERIOR TIBIALIS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **EXT HALLUCIS LONGUS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
Processing Rules:

Default Values: Use "5/5" for all muscle groups if not specified (indicates normal strength)
Strength Scale: Always use X/5 format (0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5)
doctor may also use + to document, 3+/5,4+/5 there is no 5+
Bilateral Documentation: Always include both RIGHT and LEFT columns
Omission Rule: If no motor strength mentioned in dictation, omit entire section
Global Statements: If "strength is 5/5 throughout" → fill all with 5/5

Example Parsing:

"Motor strength 5/5 bilaterally" → Fill all muscle groups with "5/5"

Alternative Muscle Group Names:

Hip flexors = Iliopsoas
Quadriceps = Quad
Knee flexors = Hamstrings
Ankle dorsiflexion = Anterior Tibialis
Great toe extension = Ext Hallicus Longus
Shoulder abduction = Deltoid
Elbow flexion = Biceps
Elbow extension = Triceps
Wrist extension = Wrist Ext
Finger flexion = Finger Flex
Finger extension = Finger Ext
Thumb extension = Thumb Ext
Grip strength/Hand grip = Hand Intrinsics

When processing medical dictation that mentions deep tendon reflexes, neurological reflexes, or DTRs, generate the following markdown table format. Only include this section if reflexes are explicitly mentioned in the transcript, context, or clinical note.

**Deep Tendon Reflexes**

*Reflex Scale: 0 = Absent, 1+ = Hypoactive, 2+ = Normal, 3+ = Hyperactive, 4+ = Hyperactive with clonus*
**NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT: DEEP TENDON REFLEXES**

| REFLEX | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------|-------|------|
| **BICEPS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **TRICEPS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **BRACHIORADIALIS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **PATELLAR** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **ACHILLES** | 2+ | 2+ |

**PATHOLOGICAL REFLEXES:**

| REFLEX | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------|-------|------|
| **BABINSKI** | Negative | Negative |
| **CLONUS (ANKLE)** | Negative | Negative |
Processing Rules:

Default Values: Use "2+" for all standard DTRs if not specified (indicates normal)
Reflex Scale: Always use 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ or Negative/Positive for pathological reflexes
Bilateral Documentation: Always include both RIGHT and LEFT columns
Standard Reflexes: Include Biceps, Triceps, Brachioradialis, Patellar, Achilles
Pathological Reflexes: Include Hoffman, Babinski, Clonus only if mentioned
Omission Rule: If no reflexes mentioned in dictation, omit entire section
Absent Reflexes: Use "0" for absent reflexes


Example Parsing:

"DTRs are 2+ bilaterally" → Fill all standard reflexes with "2+"
"Achilles reflex absent on right" → Right Achilles = "0", Left Achilles = "2+"
"Positive Babinski on left" → Left Babinski = "Positive"


**Sensory Examination** (R) (L): [document sensory examination findings for various dermatomes on the right and left sides] (Only include if explicitly mentioned in transcript, context or clinical note, else omit section entirely. Write in the same format as shown.)

**ASSESSMENT/DIAGNOSIS**: 
Doctor will mention diagnosis in his dictation, please look up relevant ICD10 codes for each diagnosis mentioned. List each diagnosis with its corresponding ICD-10 code on separate lines.

**Plan**
After doctor finishes all physical exam, diagnosis and assessment, he will say plan and give his recommendations for the treatment of the patient.  Please transcribe in paragraph form.;`
