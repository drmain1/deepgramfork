Primary Instruction:
When processing medical dictation that mentions motor strength, muscle testing, motor examination, or strength testing, generate the following markdown table format. Only include this section if motor strength is explicitly mentioned in the transcript, context, or clinical note.
Template Output:
markdown**Motor Examination** (R) (L): [document motor strength findings for various muscle groups on the right and left sides] (Only include if explicitly mentioned in transcript, context or clinical note, else omit section entirely. Write in the same format as shown.)

*Motor Strength Scale: 0/5 = No contraction, 1/5 = Trace contraction, 2/5 = Active movement without gravity, 3/5 = Active movement against gravity, 4/5 = Active movement against some resistance, 5/5 = Normal strength*

## NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT: MOTOR EXAMINATION

### Upper Extremity

| MUSCLE GROUP | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **DELTOID** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **BICEPS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **TRICEPS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **WRIST EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **FINGER FLEX** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **FINGER EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **THUMB EXT** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **HAND INTRINSICS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |

### Lower Extremity

| MUSCLE GROUP | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **ILIOPSOAS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **QUAD** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **HAMSTRINGS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **GLUTEUS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **ANTERIOR TIBIALIS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| **EXT HALLICUS LONGUS** | 5/5 | 5/5 |
Processing Rules:

Default Values: Use "5/5" for all muscle groups if not specified (indicates normal strength)
Strength Scale: Always use X/5 format (0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5)
Bilateral Documentation: Always include both RIGHT and LEFT columns
Upper Extremity Groups: Include Deltoid, Biceps, Triceps, Wrist Ext, Finger Flex, Finger Ext, Thumb Ext, Hand Intrinsics
Lower Extremity Groups: Include Iliopsoas, Quad, Hamstrings, Gluteus, Anterior Tibialis, Ext Hallicus Longus
Omission Rule: If no motor strength mentioned in dictation, omit entire section
Asymmetry: If strength differs between sides, document as dictated
Weakness: Use appropriate grade (0/5 through 4/5) based on description
Global Statements: If "strength is 5/5 throughout" → fill all with 5/5

Example Parsing:

"Motor strength 5/5 bilaterally" → Fill all muscle groups with "5/5"
"Right deltoid weakness 4/5" → Right Deltoid = "4/5", Left Deltoid = "5/5"
"Bilateral quadriceps weakness 3/5" → Both Quad = "3/5"
"Upper extremity strength normal" → All upper extremity = "5/5"
"Lower extremity weakness on left" → All left lower extremity = "4/5" (unless specific grade given)
"No movement in right hand" → Right Finger Flex, Finger Ext, Thumb Ext = "0/5"
"Grip strength decreased bilaterally" → Hand Intrinsics = "4/5" both sides

Alternative Muscle Group Names:

Hip flexors = Iliopsoas
Quadriceps = Quad
Knee flexors = Hamstrings
Ankle dorsiflexion = Anterior Tibialis
Great toe extension = Ext Hallicus Longus
Shoulder abduction = Deltoid
Elbow flexion = Biceps
Elbow extension = Triceps
Wrist extension = Wrist Ext
Finger flexion = Finger Flex
Finger extension = Finger Ext
Thumb extension = Thumb Ext
Grip strength/Hand grip = Hand Intrinsics

When processing medical dictation that mentions deep tendon reflexes, neurological reflexes, or DTRs, generate the following markdown table format. Only include this section if reflexes are explicitly mentioned in the transcript, context, or clinical note.
**Deep Tendon Reflexes** 
Template Output:
markdown(R) (L): [document reflex findings for various reflexes on the right and left sides] (Only include if explicitly mentioned in transcript, context or clinical note, else omit section entirely. Write in the same format as shown.)

*Reflex Scale: 0 = Absent, 1+ = Hypoactive, 2+ = Normal, 3+ = Hyperactive, 4+ = Hyperactive with clonus*

## NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT: DEEP TENDON REFLEXES

| REFLEX | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------|-------|------|
| **BICEPS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **TRICEPS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **BRACHIORADIALIS** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **PATELLAR** | 2+ | 2+ |
| **ACHILLES** | 2+ | 2+ |

### Additional Reflexes (if assessed):

| REFLEX | RIGHT | LEFT |
|--------|-------|------|
| **HOFFMAN** | Negative | Negative |
| **BABINSKI** | Negative | Negative |
| **CLONUS (ANKLE)** | Negative | Negative |
Processing Rules:

Default Values: Use "2+" for all standard DTRs if not specified (indicates normal)
Reflex Scale: Always use 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ or Negative/Positive for pathological reflexes
Bilateral Documentation: Always include both RIGHT and LEFT columns
Standard Reflexes: Include Biceps, Triceps, Brachioradialis, Patellar, Achilles
Pathological Reflexes: Include Hoffman, Babinski, Clonus only if mentioned
Omission Rule: If no reflexes mentioned in dictation, omit entire section
Asymmetry: If reflexes differ between sides, document as dictated
Absent Reflexes: Use "0" for absent reflexes


Example Parsing:

"DTRs are 2+ bilaterally" → Fill all standard reflexes with "2+"
"Achilles reflex absent on right" → Right Achilles = "0", Left Achilles = "2+"
"Positive Babinski on left" → Left Babinski = "Positive"
"Hyperactive reflexes in lower extremities" → Patellar and Achilles = "3+"


**Sensory Examination** (R) (L): [document sensory examination findings for various dermatomes on the right and left sides] (Only include if explicitly mentioned in transcript, context or clinical note, else omit section entirely. Write in the same format as shown.)

**ASSESSMENT/DIAGNOSIS**: 
Doctor will mention diagnosis in his dictation, please look up relevant ICD10 codes for each diagnosis mentioned. List each diagnosis with its corresponding ICD-10 code on separate lines.

**Plan**
After doctor finishes all physical exam, diagnosis and assessment, he will say plan and give his recommendations for the treatment of the patient.  Please transcribe in paragraph form.;`
