⏺ Patient Profiles Implementation Summary

  Database Schema Changes

  1. Firestore Collections Structure:
  /patients/{patientId}
  ├── user_id (string) - Firebase UID of doctor who owns this patient
  ├── first_name (string)
  ├── last_name (string) 
  ├── date_of_birth (datetime)
  ├── date_of_accident (datetime, optional)
  ├── notes_private (string, optional) - Private notes not shared with AI
  ├── notes_ai_context (string, optional) - Notes shared with AI for context
  ├── created_at (datetime)
  ├── updated_at (datetime)
  └── active (boolean) - for soft delete

  /transcripts/{transcriptId}
  └── patient_id (string, optional) - Reference to patient document

  Backend API Endpoints

  Patient Management Endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/patients - Create new patient
  - GET /api/v1/patients - List all patients for
  authenticated user
  - GET /api/v1/patients/{patient_id} - Get
  specific patient details
  - PUT /api/v1/patients/{patient_id} - Update
  patient information
  - DELETE /api/v1/patients/{patient_id} - Soft
  delete patient (sets active=false)

  Updated Session Endpoint:
  - POST /api/v1/save_session_data - Now accepts
  optional patient_id field

  Frontend Components

  1. PatientSelector Component:
  - Search functionality for existing patients
  - Add/Edit/Delete patient profiles
  - Material-UI based interface
  - Integrated with Firebase authentication
  - Private notes field for doctor's reference
  - AI context notes field for improving transcription accuracy
  - Session management to prevent duplicate backend calls

  2. PatientsPage (/patients):
  - Clean table view of all patients
  - Shows patient name, age, DOB, DOA, created date
  - Edit button (wrench icon) to modify patient details
  - Delete button (trash icon) for soft deletion
  - Click on row to view patient's transcripts
  - "Manage Patients" in sidebar navigation

  3. PatientTranscriptList (/patients/{id}/transcripts):
  - Table view of all transcripts for a patient
  - Shows date/time, encounter type, and location
  - Checkbox selection for bulk operations
  - Click row to view full transcript
  - Patient info header with DOB/DOA chips

  4. Updated SetupView:
  - "Select Patient" button next to patient name field
  - Shows selected patient info
  - Maintains backward compatibility (can still type patient name directly)
  - Auto-populates DOA in context if available

  5. Updated RecordingView:
  - Passes patient_id when saving sessions
  - Links transcripts to patient profiles
  - Debug logging for patient connection

  Performance Optimizations

  1. Frontend State Management:
  - Zustand store for patient data with 30-second caching
  - Zustand store for transcripts with 60-second caching per patient
  - Session Manager to prevent duplicate login calls (5-minute sessions)
  - Request deduplication for concurrent API calls

  2. Backend Rate Limiting:
  - Relaxed rate limits for read operations (200/min, 5000/hour)
  - Separate rate limiter for read vs write operations
  - Cache headers on patient endpoints (30s for list, 60s for transcripts)

  3. Database Indexing:
  - Added composite index for transcripts: patient_id + user_id + created_at
  - Deployed via firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

  Security

  - Firestore rules updated to secure patient collection
  - Users can only access their own patients
  - All API endpoints validate ownership
  - HIPAA-compliant audit logging for all patient data access

  Code Cleanup

  - Removed 664 lines of legacy GCS code from main.py
  - Reduced main.py from 1624 to 960 lines
  - Removed all conditional USE_FIRESTORE logic

  UI/UX Improvements

  - Consistent table-based UI for patient and transcript lists
  - Material-UI v7 components throughout
  - Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
  - Empty states with helpful guidance
  - Hover effects and visual feedback
  - Breadcrumb navigation for context
